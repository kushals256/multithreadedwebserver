iPhone History - How the iPhone Was Made
----------------------------------------
The iPhone was conceived in 2004 when Apple began developing a touchscreen device that would revolutionize mobile communication.
Steve Jobs envisioned a device that combined a phone, iPod, and internet communicator into one revolutionary product.
The development was top-secret, with Apple working on multiple prototypes including one that looked like an iPod with a rotary dial.
After years of development and countless iterations, the first iPhone was unveiled by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007, at Macworld.
The iPhone's multi-touch interface, sleek design, and intuitive user experience changed the smartphone industry forever.
